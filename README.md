# Python Challenge - Band Name Generator

Welcome to my 100-day Python challenge coding journey! The goal of this challenge is to transition from my background in DevOps to becoming a proficient Python Developer. ðŸš€

## Project 1: Band Name Generator

### Description
The Band Name Generator is a fun Python program that creates a unique band name by combining the user's city of upbringing and the name of their pet. This simple project is part of my Python coding journey, and I'm excited to showcase it here on GitHub.

### Challenge Tasks
1. Create a warm welcome for the program.
2. Inquire about the city where the user grew up.
3. Collect the name of the user's beloved pet.
4. Blend the city and pet names to unveil a one-of-a-kind band name.
5. Ensure the input cursor starts on a fresh line.

### Usage
To experience the Band Name Generator, run the following code snippet in your Python environment:

```python
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
city = input("What is the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet = input("What is the name of your pet?\n")
print("Your band could be: " + city + " " + pet)
